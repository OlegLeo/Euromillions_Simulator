This project was one of the exercises during CESAE DIGIAL's Web Development course.

The program was developed with the help of Java OOP(Object-Oriented Programming).

This is a Euromillions simulator. The program allows you to choose between 1 to 5 games, manually enter the numbers or generate random keys. The program emits how many numbers and stars you got right and the winning prize.

There is also the possibility to see how many tries it is necessary to win the 1st prize, playing always with the same key, inserting either manually or randomly generated.
